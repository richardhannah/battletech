    "Name" : "Holovid Series: MERCENARIES!",
    "Details" : "This series represents both the best and worst of what calls itself \"independent\" Holovid production in the Periphery. Without the budget—or, some say, talent—of an Inner Sphere entertainment corporation, <i>MERCENARIES!</i> makes up for this with copious adult themes, profanity, and graphic violence. Its lead actor, Brock Armstrong, enjoys a cult following in the Aurigan Reach."
