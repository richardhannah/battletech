    "Details" : "The Third Succession War began in 2866, when Coordinator Miyogi Kurita responded aggressively to rumors of the Draconis Combine's weakness, but the fighting spread to the entire Inner Sphere. Because the Successor States' military capabilities had been dramatically reduced in the previous two Succession Wars, this conflict proceeded at a slower pace and with less intensity than the earlier wars.\r\n\r\nTreaties signed in 3020 and 3022 limited the fighting, and by 3025 the Third Succession War has effectively ended.",
