    "Details" : "A Holovid series from the mid-2700s, <i>Under Cover</i> chronicled the exploits of five female secret agents of the Magistracy of Canopus masquerading as pleasure-circus employees. While some may call it kitschy by 3025 standards, its tagline of \"Taking down the Star Leagueâ€”one big shot at a time\" uniquely captures the growing sense of revolt prior to the Amaris Coup of 2766.",
