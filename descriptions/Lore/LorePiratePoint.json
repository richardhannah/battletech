    "Details" : "Nonstandard jump points that exist inside a system's proximity limit. Pirate jump points—or pirate points, for short—are hellishly difficult to navigate because they tend to be much smaller than standard jump points and are also subject to the effects of planetary gravitation. As a result, the odds of suffering a misjump when attempting to use a pirate point are high."
