    "Details" : "Born 2717, died 2779.\r\n\r\nAs President of the Rim Worlds Republic, Stefan Amaris expanded the Republican army and placed Republican agents in key positions throughout the Star League. He fostered a close relationship with Richard Cameron while the First Lord was in his minority. When Cameron came of age, Amaris guided him toward policies that would move Aleksandr Kerensky's SLDF away from Terra and place Republican forces there instead.\r\n\r\nWith these preparations in place, Stefan Amaris murdered Richard Cameron on December 27, 2766, and declared himself First Lord, beginning the Amaris Civil War.\r\n\r\nKerensky razed the Rim Worlds Republic and returned to Terra to defeat Amaris's forces and capture him. Stefan Amaris was executed by firing squad in 2779. His remains were donated to the medical school of the University of New Samarkand.",
