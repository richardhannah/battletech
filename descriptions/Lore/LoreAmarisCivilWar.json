    "Details" : "Also known as the Amaris-Kerensky Civil War and as the Amaris Coup, this was a war fought in the years 2766â€“2780 that ultimately led to the dissolution of the Star League.\r\n\r\nIn the years preceding, Stefan Amaris of the Rim Worlds Republic had become a close confidant of the young First Lord of the Star League, Richard Cameron. Amaris betrayed the First Lord's trust and killed him on December 27th, 2766. He then executed all remaining members of House Cameron and seized the throne for himself. In response, General Aleksandr Kerensky led the Star League Defense Force to conquer and destroy the Rim Worlds Republic, then turned their might toward Stefan Amaris on Terra. Kerensky's SLDF defeated Amaris and executed him and his family in late 2779.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of both House Cameron and House Amaris left no clear successor for the title of First Lord, and the Council Lords could not agree. On August 12, 2781, the Lords dissolved the Star League.",
