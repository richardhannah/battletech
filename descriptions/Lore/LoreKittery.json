    "Details" : "Previously under Capellan control, in 3005 this inhospitable jungle world was conquered by the Federated Suns. A resistance movement kept the world a war zone for many years. In the 3020s, House Liao returned and waged war for a more permanent liberation. So far it has succeeded only in creating lasting enmity between the defending 1st Kittery Borderers and the invading forces of the St. Ives Armored Cavalry.",
