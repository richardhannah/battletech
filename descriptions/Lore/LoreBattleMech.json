They are considered the most powerful and deadly surface units a military force can field. BattleMechs are classified as light (20–35 tons), medium (40–55 tons), heavy (60–75 tons), or assault (80+ tons). Because of their incredible power requirements, many 'Mechs generate ferocious amounts of waste heat, making BattleMech cockpits swelteringly hot and sometimes threatening to cause a complete system shutdown.",
