    "Details" : "An irreverent comedy, <i>Minor Major</i> follows a band of mercenaries who confirm the worst clich√©s of the profession; they're motivated solely by money and have flexible loyalty to the employer of the week. Despite the show's ham-fisted acting and lazy special effects, viewing parties are held regularly on military bases and in mercenary barracks.",
