    "Details" : "Founded by Jerome Blake after the Amaris Civil War, ComStar was created to preserve and maintain the Star League's vast communications network. With Hyperpulse Generator facilities on nearly every inhabited system in the Inner Sphere, its influence is felt everywhere. Thankfully, ComStar takes a strictly neutral approach to Inner Sphere politics; it takes no sides and offers no preferential treatment.\r\n\r\nCulturally, ComStar has lapsed from a corporation into a religious institution. In Blake's name, ComStar adepts perpetuate the belief that Hyperpulse transmissions are a form of sacred magic that only they can control.",
