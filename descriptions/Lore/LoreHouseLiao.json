    "Details" : "\"ONE VISION.\" The Capellan Confederation is the smallest of the Successor States, and was the last to form, created on Capella by neighboring states in 2366. House Liao gave the Confederation its Han Chinese character and ensured the survival of the realm through strong (if frequently erratic) rule. Popularly disparaged as a totalitarian police state, many Capellan citizens enjoy a high degree of personal freedom and willingly serve the State in return for the generous services it provides.",
