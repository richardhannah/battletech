    "Details" : "Medics are skilled professionals, and medics willing to leave the relative safety of a planet to travel with a rough-and-tumble mercenary company are rare. Still, they're a critical part of the crew, especially when MechWarriors come back from battle injured and are out of action for weeks or even months.\n\nTo reduce this expense, fire one or more of your medics, but be aware that MechWarriors will take longer to heal from their battle injuries.",
