    "Details" : "MechWarriors are highly paid professionals, and more effective and skilled MechWarriors will demand a higher quarterly salary as well as a high signing bonus. MechWarriors you train yourself are somewhat less expensive.\n\nTo reduce this expense, fire one or more of your MechWarriors, or replace them with less-skilled personnel. Make sure you keep enough pilots available to deploy your lance in combat, though.",
